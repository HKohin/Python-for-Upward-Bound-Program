Consider the following:
Find the total amount remaining in the pocket. 

Money in pocket = 100
bill = 40 
tip = 10% of the bill
total bill = bill + tip  
total money in pocket remaining

I hope this is clear enough. Use common logic to get to the answer. Extra credits will be 
given for using short hand notation.
